## What is a Web server?

It accepts requests from clients(users), then it returns a response. Along this lesson we will be creating a super simple [Web Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server), to handle GET HTTP requests correctly.

## How HTTP and TCP work together

* **TCP** is a transport protocol that describes how a server and a client exchange data.

* **HTTP** is a request-response protocol that specifically describes how web servers exchange data with HTTP clients or web browsers. HTTP commonly uses TCP as its transport protocol. In essence, an HTTP server is a TCP server that "speaks" HTTP.

## Launch a TCP server

Ruby provides a [TCPServer](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/socket/rdoc/TCPServer.html) class to create TCP connection.

```ruby
#tcp_server.rb
require 'socket'
server = TCPServer.new '0.0.0.0', 5678

while session = server.accept
  session.puts "Hello world! The time is #{Time.now}"
  session.close
end
```

In this example above, the server binds to port **5678** and waits for a client to connect. When that happens, it sends a message to the client, and then closes the connection. After it's done talking to the first client, the server waits for another client to connect to send its message to again.

```ruby
#tcp_client.rb
require 'socket'
server = TCPSocket.new 'localhost', 5678

while line = server.gets
  puts line
end

server.close
```

To connect to our server, we'll need a TCP client. This example client connects to the same port (5678) and uses `server.gets` to receive data from the server, which is then printed. When it stops receiving data, it closes the connection to the server and the program will exit.

When you start the server by running `ruby tcp_server.rb`, you can start the client in a separate tab to receive the server's message:

```bash
$ ruby tcp_client.rb
Hello world! The time is 2016-11-23 15:17:11 +0100
```
## A Minimal Ruby HTTP server

Enough talk. Now that we know how to create a TCP server in Ruby and what some HTTP requests and responses look like, we can build a minimal HTTP server. You'll notice that the web server looks mostly the same as the TCP server we discussed earlier. The general idea is the same, we're just using the HTTP protocol to format our message. Also, because we'll use a browser to send requests and parse responses, we won't have to implement a client this time.

```ruby
# http_server.rb
require 'socket'
server = TCPServer.new 5678

while session = server.accept
  request = session.gets
  puts request

  session.print "HTTP/1.1 200\r\n" # 1
  session.print "Content-Type: text/html\r\n" # 2
  session.print "\r\n" # 3
  session.print "Hello world! The time is #{Time.now}" #4

  session.close
end
```

After the server receives a request, like before, it uses `session.print` to send a message back to the client: Instead of just the server message, it prefixes the response with a status line, a header and a newline:

* The status line (HTTP 1.1 200\r\n) to tell the browser that the HTTP version is 1.1 and the response code is "200"

* A header to indicate that the response has a text/html content type (Content-Type: text/html\r\n)

* The newline (\r\n)

* The body: "Hello world! â€¦"

Like before, it closes the connection after sending the message. We're not reading the request yet, so it just prints it to the console for now.

If you start the server and open http://localhost:5678 in your browser, you should see the "Hello world! â€¦" string with the current time, like we received from our TCP client earlier. ðŸŽ‰

## Serving a Rack app

Until now, our server has been returning a single response for each request. To make it a little more useful, we could add more responses to our server. Instead of adding these to the server directly, we'll use a `Rack` app. Our server will parse HTTP requests and pass them to the Rack app, which will then return a response for the server and send back to the client.

`Rack` is an interface between web servers that supports Ruby and most Ruby web frameworks like Rails and Sinatra. In its simplest form, a Rack app is an object that responds to call and returns a "tiplet", an array with three items: an HTTP response code, a hash of HTTP headers and a body.

This is how a basic `Rack` application looks like:

```ruby
  app = Proc.new do |env|
    ['200', {'Content-Type' => 'text/html'}, ["Hello world! The time is #{Time.now}"]]
  end
```

In this example, the response code is `200`, we're passing `text/html` as the content type through the headers, and the body is an array with a string.

To allow our server to serve responses from this app, we'll need to turn the returned triplet into a HTTP response string. Instead of always returning a static response, like we did before, we'll now have to build the response from the triplet returned by the Rack app.

```ruby
  # http_server.rb
  require 'socket'

  app = Proc.new do
    ['200', {'Content-Type' => 'text/html'}, ["Hello world! The time is #{Time.now}"]]
  end

  server = TCPServer.new 5678

  while session = server.accept
    request = session.gets
    puts request

    # 1
    status, headers, body = app.call({})

    # 2
    session.print "HTTP/1.1 #{status}\r\n"

    # 3
    headers.each do |key, value|
      session.print "#{key}: #{value}\r\n"
    end

    # 4
    session.print "\r\n"

    # 5
    body.each do |part|
      session.print part
    end
    session.close
  end
```
